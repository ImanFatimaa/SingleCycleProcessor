# SingleCycleProcessor
Our project focuses on designing and implementing a single-cycle processor, a fundamental CPU architecture where each instruction completes within a single clock cycle. This processor is specifically tailored to execute a subset of MIPS instructions efficiently, adhering closely to the MIPS architecture principles. The design encompasses essential stages such as instruction fetching, decoding, execution using an ALU, memory access, and write-back. Our objectives include achieving functional completeness through rigorous simulation and verification processes. We aim to optimize performance by carefully managing resources and ensuring minimal latency in instruction execution. Through meticulous testing and documentation, we intend to analyze the processor's efficiency, trade-offs between simplicity and performance, and its practical applicability in real-world computing tasks. This project not only emphasizes hands-on experience in processor design and implementation but also provides insights into the complexities and optimizations involved in CPU architecture.
